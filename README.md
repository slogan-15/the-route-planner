## The Route Planner based on Dijkstra's Shortest Path First algorithm

Route planner is solved using Java and some concepts from graph theory. It has 3 classes:
FindRoute ​as main class, ​ Node ​a representation of a station and ​Edge ​representing a route
to station with distance.

### How to run it from Linux command line
``` 
$ javac *.java && java FindRoute route-file.txt Furenes Sløvåg

result: Furenes -> Eivindvik -> Rutledal -> Sløvåg: 32 minutes.
```
